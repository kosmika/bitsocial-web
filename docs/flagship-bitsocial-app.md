# Flagship Bitsocial App

The flagship Bitsocial app is the proposed first profile-based client for the network. The simplest
comparison is: familiar like X/Twitter by default, but with the platform layer broken open.

It would add profiles, follows, replies, feeds, communities, notifications, and real-time public
conversation while keeping the underlying services replaceable. 5chan proves anonymous communities
can work. Seedit moves toward persistent discussion. The flagship app would bring those network
effects into a mainstream social feed without making one company the owner of the graph.

This page describes product direction, not a locked release spec. The exact interface, default feed,
ad model, AI features, and RPC marketplace can change as the protocol and early apps mature.

## What it should prove

The app should prove that a profile-based social network can avoid becoming a custodial platform:

- users can own identities and profiles
- communities and profile nodes can stay peer-to-peer
- communities can carry network effects across Bitsocial clients
- RPC providers can make the app convenient without taking custody
- feed algorithms can be optional services instead of platform law
- other clients can still compete for the same network

The point is not to make the only Bitsocial client. The point is to make the first broad client that
shows how far the protocol can stretch.

## Familiar by default, replaceable by design

The default experience should be competitive with mainstream public conversation apps: a fast home
feed, follows, replies, repost-style distribution, communities, notifications, search, and a ranked
For You view that works immediately.

Bitsocial Forge can run the first default RPC and feed service. That default can include a ranked
feed and ads so the app feels complete on day one instead of asking mainstream users to assemble the
whole stack themselves.

The difference is that the default should not become the prison. A user should be able to switch
RPCs, feeds, instances, ranking systems, ads, and discovery providers, or remove ranking entirely.
The app can be opinionated at first launch while keeping every major service replaceable.

That makes the app more customizable than a conventional platform. One user might keep the default
ranked feed with ads. Another might use a chronological feed with no ranking. Another might choose a
privacy-focused RPC, a community-run discovery service, a paid ad-free feed, or a niche algorithm
built for a specific subculture.

## Cross-client communities

Communities should be much more important than isolated groups inside one app.

On X/Twitter, communities are confined inside X. They can be useful, but they inherit the limits of
one platform, one account system, one recommendation stack, and one product surface.

A Bitsocial community can be created, hosted, discovered, and used through different clients. That
means the flagship app can show communities and posts from the wider Bitsocial network, not only from
users who started inside the flagship app. A community could have activity from an imageboard client,
a Reddit-style discussion client, a niche forum client, a mobile app, and the flagship app at the same
time.

That is the core network-effect advantage: one client can feel familiar to mainstream users while
still pulling value from many clients, community nodes, RPC providers, and independent services.

## Optional feed algorithms

The flagship app should not force one global ranking system on everyone.

Feed algorithms should be opt-in. A user could choose an algorithm from a marketplace, switch
providers, use an algorithm from a company, use one run by an anonymous operator, use one built by a
community, run a personal one, or use no algorithm at all.

Public RPC providers are a natural place for these services to compete. They can index, rank, and
recommend content, but they should not own the user or the profile.

Those services can also compete on the shape of the app itself. One RPC might provide a ranked feed
with ads. Another might provide an unranked chronological feed. Another might specialize in privacy,
translation, moderation, community discovery, or a niche social graph.

If the economics work, RPC-backed feed services could add AI features similar to what mainstream
platforms are trying to put into their feeds: automatic translations, summaries, bot-assisted
replies, search answers, moderation assistance, or community-note style context.

Those features should be service choices, not protocol requirements. A default RPC can compete by
offering a richer feed, but users and competing clients should still be able to choose simpler,
private, chronological, ad-free, or community-specific alternatives.

## Non-custodial RPC

Each user should be able to participate as a full peer-to-peer node through RPC without giving the
RPC provider ownership over their identity or profile.

The hosted path matters because most users will not start by running a server. The exit path matters
just as much: a user should be able to move to their own profile node on low-spec hardware, including
a Raspberry Pi, whenever they want.

That is the difference between convenience and custody.

## Why it can become an everything-app

If Bitsocial Chain gives apps durable naming, payments, tipping, awards, and other financial
rails, the flagship app could become much more than a feed client.

The important constraint is that the app should not become the new owner of the network. It can be a
large client, maybe even the most popular client, while still leaving room for competing apps,
competing RPCs, competing feed algorithms, and self-hosted profile nodes.
