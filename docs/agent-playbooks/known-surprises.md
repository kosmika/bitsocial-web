### Vercel app production domains can drift back to Git master deployments

- **Date:** 2026-04-28
- **Observed by:** Tommaso + Codex
- **Context:** Verifying Seedit and 5chan app mirrors in the Bitsocial Web app directory.
- **What was surprising:** The Vercel `seedit` and `5chan` projects had `gitProviderOptions.createDeployments = "enabled"`, so GitHub `master` pushes were promoted to the production domains even though the repo policy expects production app mirrors to serve release artifacts only.
- **Impact:** App-directory verified mirror badges can become false because production domains serve the latest development commit instead of the GitHub release ZIP whose `index.html` hash is recorded in `about/src/lib/apps-data.ts`.
- **Mitigation:** Before adding or refreshing mirror verification metadata, check the Vercel project with `vercel api /v9/projects/<project-id>` and confirm `gitProviderOptions.createDeployments = "disabled"`. Deploy release ZIP contents with `vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod` and use `seedit-omega.vercel.app` or `5chan-omega.vercel.app` for development deployments.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Portless 0.11 reuses legacy proxy state unless the launcher forces HTTPS

- **Date:** 2026-04-28
- **Observed by:** Tommaso + Codex
- **Context:** Upgrading the normal `yarn start` flow from the old `http://bitsocial.localhost:1355` proxy URL to `https://bitsocial.localhost`.
- **What was surprising:** Even with `portless@0.11.1` installed, Portless reused the existing `~/.portless/proxy.port = 1355` HTTP proxy and printed the legacy `:1355` URL.
- **Impact:** Updating package versions and docs is not enough; `yarn start` can still advertise and use the old URL when a contributor has legacy Portless state running.
- **Mitigation:** Keep the start scripts explicitly starting the Portless HTTPS proxy on port `443` before registering app routes, so the runtime flow migrates away from persisted `1355` state instead of inheriting it.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Portless changes the canonical local app URL

- **Date:** 2026-03-18
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Browser verification and smoke flows
- **What was surprising:** The default local URL is not the usual Vite port. The repo expects `https://bitsocial.localhost` through Portless, so checking `localhost:3000` or `localhost:5173` can hit the wrong app or nothing at all.
- **Impact:** Browser checks can fail or validate the wrong target even when the dev server is healthy.
- **Mitigation:** Use `https://bitsocial.localhost` first. Only bypass it with `PORTLESS=0 corepack yarn start` when you explicitly need a direct Vite port.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Commitizen hooks block non-interactive commits

- **Date:** 2026-03-18
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Agent-driven commit workflows
- **What was surprising:** `git commit` triggers Commitizen through Husky and waits for interactive TTY input, which hangs non-interactive agent shells.
- **Impact:** Agents can stall indefinitely during what should be a normal commit.
- **Mitigation:** Use `git commit --no-verify -m "message"` for agent-created commits. Humans can still use `corepack yarn commit` or `corepack yarn exec cz`.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Corepack is required to avoid Yarn classic

- **Date:** 2026-03-19
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Package manager migration to Yarn 4
- **What was surprising:** The machine still has a global Yarn classic install on `PATH`, so running plain `yarn` can resolve to v1 instead of the pinned Yarn 4 version.
- **Impact:** Developers can accidentally bypass the repo's package-manager pinning and get different install behavior or lockfile output.
- **Mitigation:** Use `corepack yarn ...` for shell commands, or run `corepack enable` first so plain `yarn` resolves to the pinned Yarn 4 version.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Fixed Portless app names collide across Bitsocial Web worktrees

- **Date:** 2026-03-30
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Starting `yarn start` in one Bitsocial Web worktree while another worktree was already serving through Portless
- **What was surprising:** Using the literal Portless app name `bitsocial` in every worktree makes the route itself collide, even when the backing ports are different, so the second process fails because `bitsocial.localhost` is already registered.
- **Impact:** Parallel Bitsocial Web branches can block each other even though Portless is meant to let them coexist safely.
- **Mitigation:** Keep Portless startup behind `scripts/start-dev.mjs`, which now uses a branch-scoped `*.bitsocial.localhost` route outside the canonical case and falls back to a branch-scoped route when the bare `bitsocial.localhost` name is already occupied.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Docs preview used to hard-code port 3001

- **Date:** 2026-03-30
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Running `yarn start` alongside other local repos and agents
- **What was surprising:** The root dev command ran the docs workspace with `docusaurus start --port 3001`, so the whole dev session failed whenever another process already owned `3001`, even though the main app already used Portless.
- **Impact:** `yarn start` could kill the web process immediately after it booted, interrupting unrelated local work over a docs-port collision.
- **Mitigation:** Keep docs startup behind `yarn start:docs`, which now uses Portless plus `scripts/start-docs.mjs` to honor an injected free port or fall back to the next available port when run directly.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Fixed docs Portless hostname was hard-coded

- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Running `yarn start` in a secondary Bitsocial Web worktree while another worktree was already serving docs through Portless
- **What was surprising:** `start:docs` still registered the literal `docs.bitsocial.localhost` hostname, so `yarn start` could fail even though the about app already knew how to avoid Portless route collisions for its own hostname.
- **Impact:** Parallel worktrees could not reliably use the root dev command because the docs process exited first and `concurrently` then killed the rest of the session.
- **Mitigation:** Keep docs startup behind `scripts/start-docs.mjs`, which now derives the same branch-scoped Portless hostname as the about app and injects that shared public URL into the `/docs` dev proxy target.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Worktree shells can miss the repo's pinned Node version

- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Running `yarn start` in Git worktrees such as `.claude/worktrees/*` or sibling worktree checkouts
- **What was surprising:** Some worktree shells resolved `node` and `yarn node` to Homebrew Node `25.2.1` even though the repo pins `22.12.0` in `.nvmrc`, so `yarn start` could silently run the dev launchers under the wrong runtime.
- **Impact:** Dev-server behavior can drift between the main checkout and worktrees, making bugs hard to reproduce and violating the repo's expected Node 22 toolchain.
- **Mitigation:** Keep the dev launchers behind `scripts/start-dev.mjs` and `scripts/start-docs.mjs`, which now re-exec under the `.nvmrc` Node binary when the current shell is on the wrong version. Shell setup should still prefer `nvm use`.
- **Status:** confirmed

### `docs-site/` leftovers can hide missing docs source after the refactor

- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Post-merge monorepo cleanup after moving the Docusaurus project from `docs-site/` to `docs/`
- **What was surprising:** The old `docs-site/` folder can remain on disk with stale but important files like `i18n/`, even after the tracked repo moved to `docs/`. That makes the refactor look duplicated locally and can hide the fact that tracked docs translations were not actually moved into `docs/`.
- **Impact:** Agents can delete the old folder as “junk” and accidentally lose the only local copy of docs translations, or keep editing scripts that still point at the dead `docs-site/` path.
- **Mitigation:** Treat `docs/` as the only canonical docs project. Before deleting any local `docs-site/` leftovers, restore tracked source like `docs/i18n/` and update scripts and hooks to stop referencing `docs-site`.
- **Status:** confirmed

### Multilocale docs preview can spike RAM during verification

- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Fixing docs i18n, locale routing, and Pagefind behavior with `yarn start:docs` plus Playwright
- **What was surprising:** The default docs preview mode now does a full multilocale docs build plus Pagefind indexing before serving, and keeping that process alive alongside multiple Playwright or Chrome sessions can consume much more RAM than a normal Vite or single-locale Docusaurus dev loop.
- **Impact:** The machine can become memory-constrained, browser sessions can crash, and interrupted runs can leave stale docs servers or headless browsers behind that keep consuming memory.
- **Mitigation:** For docs work that does not need locale-route or Pagefind verification, prefer `DOCS_START_MODE=live yarn start:docs`. Only use the default multilocale preview when you need to validate translated routes or Pagefind. Keep a single Playwright session, close old browser sessions before opening new ones, and stop the docs server after verification if you no longer need it.
- **Status:** confirmed

### `translate-docs.py` can leave docs locales half-translated or with broken link targets

- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Fixing localized docs routes and content after `yarn start:docs` served English detail pages or failed to build locale output
- **What was surprising:** The docs translation pipeline had two repo-specific failure modes at once: `scripts/translate-docs.py` only extracted a small subset of `DocsHome` messages when `tr(...)` calls used forms it did not parse, and translated markdown under `docs/i18n/**` could contain machine-translated slugs or `ZXQPLACEHOLDER` artifacts inside link targets.
- **Impact:** Localized homepages can silently fall back to English, localized detail pages can appear untranslated, and full `yarn docs:build` can fail on broken locale links even though the source docs are valid.
- **Mitigation:** After changing docs translations or regenerating locale files, always run `yarn docs:build` from the repo root, scan `docs/i18n/**` markdown for `ZXQPLACEHOLDER`, and verify translated links still point to canonical doc slugs such as `/apps/5chan/` instead of translated URL paths. If `DocsHome` copy changed, confirm `scripts/translate-docs.py` still extracts all `docs.home.*` messages.
- **Status:** confirmed

### About-site no-JS checks must use the Portless route, not a standalone SSR preview

- **Date:** 2026-04-12
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Verifying no-JS support for the `about/` site from a branch worktree
- **What was surprising:** A standalone SSR preview can look healthy while the actual branch-scoped Portless route is still serving the wrong app shell or an older process. In this repo, the real local contract is the Portless hostname from `yarn start`, not an ad hoc preview server.
- **Impact:** Agents can incorrectly claim no-JS support works, or miss regressions that only show up on `*.bitsocial.localhost`.
- **Mitigation:** For `about/` browser verification, always start the real local server with `yarn start` or `yarn start:about` and test the branch-scoped Portless URL first. If a Portless hostname looks stale, inspect and stop the old process before retesting.
- **Status:** confirmed

### `chain/` was invisible to `yarn build:verify` and `yarn doctor`

- **Date:** 2026-07-05
- **Observed by:** Codex
- **Context:** Verifying a chain/-only diff after the `chain/` workspace (standalone Vite app for `chain.bitsocial.net`) was added to the monorepo.
- **What was surprising:** `scripts/verify-build.mjs` only recognized `about/`, `docs/`, and `stats/` path prefixes, so a chain/-only diff printed "No targeted build checks matched the current diff" and ran no build at all, even though `build:chain` already existed in the root `package.json`. Separately, `yarn doctor` was hard-coded to `react-doctor about -y`, so React changes under `chain/src` got zero React Doctor coverage.
- **Impact:** Agents verifying chain changes had to know to call `yarn build:chain` directly instead of trusting `yarn build:verify`, and React issues in `chain/src` (effects, hooks, dead code) went undetected by `yarn doctor`.
- **Mitigation:** `scripts/verify-build.mjs` now has a `chain/` branch mirroring the `about/` one, and `doctor` / `doctor:verbose` now run `react-doctor --project about,chain -y` in a single invocation. `doctor:score` stays `about`-only because `--score` silently prints nothing when combined with `--project` for more than one project; use `yarn react-doctor --project about,chain --verbose -y` (or `--json`) if a chain score is needed.
- **Status:** confirmed
