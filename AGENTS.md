# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file defines the always-on rules for AI agents working on Bitsocial Web.
Use this as the default policy. Load linked playbooks only when their trigger condition applies.

## Surprise Handling

The role of this file is to reduce recurring agent mistakes and confusion points in this repository.
If you encounter something surprising or ambiguous while working, alert the developer immediately.
After confirmation, add a concise entry to `docs/agent-playbooks/known-surprises.md` so future agents avoid the same issue.
Only record items that are repo-specific, likely to recur, and have a concrete mitigation.

## Project Overview

Bitsocial Web is a small monorepo for the public Bitsocial web surface:

- `about/` for the Bitsocial landing/about site served at `bitsocial.net`
- `docs/` for the Docusaurus docs served at `bitsocial.net/docs`
- `stats/` for Grafana, Prometheus, and deployment assets behind `bitsocial.net/stats`

## Instruction Priority

- **MUST** rules are mandatory.
- **SHOULD** rules are strong defaults unless task context requires a different choice.
- If guidance conflicts, prefer: user request > MUST > SHOULD > playbooks.

## Agent Operating Principles

- Before editing, state important assumptions when the task is ambiguous. Ask instead of silently choosing between materially different interpretations.
- Prefer the smallest implementation that solves the requested problem. Do not add speculative abstractions, configurability, or features.
- Keep diffs surgical. Do not refactor, reformat, rename, or "improve" adjacent code unless it is necessary for the task.
- Clean up only artifacts created by the current change, such as newly unused imports or dead helper code.
- For non-trivial work, define success criteria and verify them with the narrowest reliable checks before marking the task complete.

## LLM Knowledge Base Policy

Use compiled context for orientation, not as source of truth.

Source of truth:

- Code, tests, package manifests, docs, and runtime/live evidence when relevant.

Compiled context:

- `AGENTS.md`, directory-specific `AGENTS.md` files, `CLAUDE.md`, and repo-managed `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, and `.claude/` workflow files.
- `docs/agent-playbooks/**`, `docs/agent-runs/**`, `docs/agent-playbooks/known-surprises.md`, `about/public/llms*.txt`, and `docs/static/llms*.txt`.

Agents may use compiled context to navigate quickly, but must verify against source files before making behavioral claims or edits. External code graph, RAG, MCP, or wiki tools are optional local accelerators unless the developer explicitly asks to make one part of the committed workflow.

## Task Router (Read First)

| Situation | Required action |
| Situation | Required action |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React UI logic changed (`about/src/components`, `about/src/pages`, `about/src/app.tsx`, `about/src/main.tsx`, `about/src/lib`) | Follow React architecture rules below and run `yarn doctor` |
| `package.json` changed | Run `yarn install` to keep `yarn.lock` in sync |
| Dependencies or import graph changed | Run `yarn knip` as an advisory manifest/import audit |
| Translation key/value changed | Use `docs/agent-playbooks/translations.md` |
| Public-facing English content changed (`about/public/translations/en/default.json`, docs pages, app directory data, public README text, or `scripts/generate-llms-files.mjs`) | Run `yarn llms:generate`; inspect and commit any resulting changes to `about/public/llms*.txt` and `docs/static/llms*.txt` so LLM indexes stay current |
| Bug report in a specific file/line | Start with git history scan from `docs/agent-playbooks/bug-investigation.md` before editing |
| UI or visual behavior changed | Verify in browser with `playwright-cli` across Chrome/Blink, Firefox/Gecko, and WebKit/Safari; check desktop and mobile behavior when relevant |
| Frontend UI design, redesign, critique, audit, polish, layout, typography, color, motion, or visual hierarchy work | Use the `impeccable` skill (one entry point with 23 design subcommands under `/impeccable`) |
| Browsing performance regression, rerender hotspot, or route jank needs investigation | Use the `profile-browsing` skill |
| Need to map a rendered DOM node back to the React file that produced it | Use the `inspect-elements` skill |
| Long-running task spans multiple sessions, handoffs, or spawned agents | Use `docs/agent-playbooks/long-running-agent-workflow.md`, keep a machine-readable feature list plus a progress log, and run `./scripts/agent-init.sh --smoke` before starting a fresh feature slice |
| New reviewable feature, fix, docs change, or chore started while on `master` | Create a short-lived `codex/feature/*`, `codex/fix/*`, `codex/docs/*`, or `codex/chore/*` branch from `master` before editing; use a separate worktree only for parallel tasks |
| New unrelated task started while another task branch is already checked out or being worked on by another agent | Create a separate worktree from `master`, create a new short-lived task branch there, and keep each agent on its own worktree, branch, and PR |
| Open PR needs feedback triage or merge readiness check | Use the `review-and-merge-pr` skill |
| Repo AI workflow files changed (`.codex/**`, `.cursor/**`, `.claude/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-playbooks/**`, `scripts/agent-hooks/**`) | Keep the Codex, Cursor, and Claude copies aligned when they represent the same workflow; update `AGENTS.md` if the default agent policy changes |
| GitHub operation needed | Use `gh` CLI, not GitHub MCP |
| User asks for commit or issue phrasing | Use `docs/agent-playbooks/commit-issue-format.md` |
| Surprising or ambiguous repo behavior encountered | Alert the developer and, once confirmed, document it in `docs/agent-playbooks/known-surprises.md` |

## Core MUST Rules

### Package and Dependency Rules

- Use Yarn 4 via Corepack, never `npm` or `bun`.
- Use exact versions for `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies` in every tracked `package.json`. Do not introduce semver ranges, `^`, `~`, wildcard ranges, or tags like `latest`.
- Keep the repo's Yarn registry hardening enabled: exact-version defaults, checksum verification, and a 3-day `npmMinimalAgeGate`. If a dependency or lockfile change needs to bypass the age gate, document the reason before introducing a preapproval exception.
- Keep `yarn.lock` synchronized when dependency manifests change.
- Keep Yarn configured to add exact versions by default, keep `yarn deps:check-pinned` passing, and run `yarn deps:check-hardened` when dependency manifests or `yarn.lock` change.
- Respect the repo's existing dependency versioning style. Do not rewrite version ranges just to satisfy a personal preference.

### React Architecture Rules

- Keep route composition in `about/src/pages/`, reusable UI in `about/src/components/`, and shared helpers in `about/src/lib/`.
- Do not use `useEffect` to synchronize derived state that can be calculated during render.
- Prefer extracting repeated UI or logic instead of copy-pasting across pages.
- Use `@/` imports for `about/src/**`. Do not introduce new `../` imports into that source tree.
- Preserve `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks whenever you add or change animation.
- Use React Router for navigation instead of manual `window.location` changes unless there is a clear reason.

### Code Organization Rules

- Keep page components focused on page composition. Move reusable sections and primitives into `about/src/components/`.
- Follow the existing visual system in `about/src/index.css` and `about/tailwind.config.ts` instead of inventing a parallel styling layer.
- Add comments only for non-obvious reasoning, constraints, or tradeoffs.

### Git Workflow Rules

- Keep `master` releasable. Do not treat `master` as a scratch branch.
- If the user asks for a reviewable feature or fix and the current branch is `master`, create a short-lived task branch before making code changes unless the user explicitly asks to work directly on `master`.
- Name short-lived AI task branches by intent under the Codex prefix: `codex/feature/*`, `codex/fix/*`, `codex/docs/*`, `codex/chore/*`.
- Open PRs from task branches into `master` so review bots can run against the actual change.
- Never open PRs as draft unless the user explicitly asks for a draft PR. Bugbot and other review automation may not run on drafts.
- Prefer short-lived task branches over long-lived staging branches unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- Use worktrees only when parallel tasks need isolated checkouts. One active task branch per worktree.
- If a new task is unrelated to the currently checked out branch, do not stack it on that branch. Create a new worktree from `master` and create a separate short-lived task branch there.
- Always give a new worktree a descriptive name that reflects the task (e.g. `fix-login-redirect`, not `wt1`, `tmp`, `feature`, or a numbered slug), so it can be identified at a glance in a long list of worktrees. When using `./scripts/create-task-worktree.sh`, the `<slug>` argument must be that descriptive name.
- Prefer `./scripts/create-task-worktree.sh <feature|fix|docs|chore> <slug>` when you need a new task worktree and do not have a stronger repo-specific reason to create it manually.
- Treat branch and worktree as different things: the branch is the change set; the worktree is the checkout where that branch is worked on.
- For parallel unrelated tasks, give each task its own branch from `master`, its own worktree, and its own PR into `master`.

### Bug Investigation Rules

- For bug reports tied to a specific file or line, check relevant git history before any fix.
- Minimum sequence: `git log --oneline` or `git blame` first, then scoped `git show` for relevant commits.
- Full workflow: `docs/agent-playbooks/bug-investigation.md`.

### Verification Rules

- Never mark work complete without verification.
- Use the Node 22.12.0 toolchain from `.nvmrc`; after `corepack enable`, run plain `yarn` commands.
- After code changes, run the smallest relevant build check plus `yarn lint` and `yarn typecheck`.
- Use `yarn build:verify` as the default build check for local verification; it auto-selects the affected workspace build instead of rebuilding every docs locale.
- Use `yarn build` only when you intentionally need the full production build, including the multi-locale docs output.
- Before handing off a PR or commit, also run `yarn format:check`.
- After React UI logic changes, run `yarn doctor`.
- Treat React Doctor output as actionable guidance; prioritize `error` then `warning`.
- For UI or visual changes, verify with `playwright-cli` on the local dev URL across Chrome/Blink, Firefox/Gecko, and WebKit/Safari.
- Cover a mobile viewport flow in each browser engine when the change affects layout, touch behavior, or responsiveness.
- The shared hook verification path is strict by default. Only set `AGENT_VERIFY_MODE=advisory` when you intentionally need signal from a broken tree without blocking the session.
- If verification fails, fix and re-run until passing or until you hit a real blocker you can explain concretely.
- Do not commit or force-add generated build output. `dist/` is the main generated output in this repo; remove or restore it after local verification before committing.

### Tooling Constraints

- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub work.
- Do not use GitHub MCP.
- Do not use browser MCP servers. Use `playwright-cli`.
- If many MCP tools are present in context, warn the user and suggest disabling the unused ones.

### AI Tooling Rules

- Treat `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, and `.claude/` as repo-managed contributor tooling, not private scratch space.
- Do not add or use a repo-level `.agents/` directory. Keep skills in `.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, and `.claude/skills/` only.
- Keep equivalent workflow files aligned across all toolchains when their directories contain the same skill, hook, or agent.
- Keep model names toolchain-specific: `composer-2` is Cursor-only and must not appear under `.claude/` or `.codex/`; `.codex/agents/**` should use `gpt-5.4` by default and `gpt-5.4-mini` only for intentionally lightweight tasks such as translation. Do not use `gpt-5.3-codex` or `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` in `.codex/`.
- Keep shared policy in tracked files when possible: `AGENTS.md`, `about/AGENTS.md`, `about/src/AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `stats/AGENTS.md`, `scripts/AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-playbooks/**`, and `scripts/agent-hooks/**`.
- When changing shared agent behavior, update the relevant files in `.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`, `.cursor/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/hooks/`, `.cursor/hooks/`, `.claude/hooks/`, and their `hooks.json` or config entry points as needed.
- Review `.codex/config.toml`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, and `.claude/hooks.json` before changing agent orchestration or hook behavior, because they are the entry points contributors will actually load.
- When a diff adds new `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useInsertionEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `memo(...)` usage under `about/src/`, treat the repo hook reminder as mandatory and reconsider the change with `you-might-not-need-an-effect` and `vercel-react-best-practices` before finishing.
- Directory-specific auto-loaded rules live under `about/AGENTS.md`, `about/src/AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `stats/AGENTS.md`, and `scripts/AGENTS.md`; read them before editing files in those trees.
- For work expected to span multiple sessions, keep explicit task state in a `feature-list.json` plus `progress.md` pair using `docs/agent-playbooks/long-running-agent-workflow.md`.
- If more than one human or toolchain needs the same task state, keep it in a tracked location such as `docs/agent-runs/<slug>/` instead of burying it in a tool-specific hidden directory.

### Security and Boundaries

- Never commit secrets or API keys.
- Never push to a remote unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not build wallet integration, authentication, governance, token dashboards, or backend services in this repo.

## Core SHOULD Rules

- Keep context lean: delegate heavy or verbose tasks when possible.
- For complex work, parallelize independent checks.
- When touching already-covered logic, prefer extending nearby tests or clearly call out the missing coverage if the repo area has no existing test harness.
- Use `yarn knip` when adding/removing dependencies or introducing new direct imports; treat findings as advisory, but resolve real issues before finishing.
- When proposing or implementing meaningful code changes, include both:
  - a Conventional Commit title suggestion
  - a short GitHub issue suggestion
    Use the format playbook: `docs/agent-playbooks/commit-issue-format.md`.
- When stuck on a bug, search the web for recent fixes or workarounds.
- After user corrections, identify the root cause and apply the lesson in subsequent steps.

## Local Development URLs

This project uses [Portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless) for local dev. The canonical dev URL is `https://bitsocial.localhost`, and non-`master` branches can automatically fall back to a branch-scoped `*.bitsocial.localhost` route when needed so parallel worktrees do not collide. To bypass Portless, use `PORTLESS=0 yarn start`.

Android phone over USB (default browser opens via `adb`; `ANDROID_USB_OPEN_BROWSER=0` to skip): `yarn start:android-usb`

## Common Commands

```bash
yarn install
yarn start          # https://bitsocial.localhost
