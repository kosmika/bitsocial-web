## Bitsocial Stats Monitor

This service powers the Prometheus metrics and JSON API used by the Grafana dashboards under `bitsocial.net/stats`.

### Running locally

```bash
yarn install
yarn start:stats-monitor -- --only webpages
```

For the full local Grafana stack, use:

```bash
yarn stats:up
```

The main configuration lives in [config.js](./config.js). Community monitoring is client-aware:

- `5chan` is enabled now via the generated snapshot from the official `5chan-directories/` files
- `5chan` community labels remain the public `.bso` aliases, but the monitor queries the matching `.eth` community internally because that is what current clients resolve against
- future clients can be added through `monitoring.clients`
- container deployments can override the local Kubo RPC endpoints with `BITSOCIAL_STATS_KUBO_RPC_URL` and `BITSOCIAL_STATS_PUBSUB_KUBO_RPC_URL`

The API listens on port `3000` by default:

- `/` returns the current JSON snapshot
- `/history` returns stored snapshots over time
- `/metrics/prometheus` exposes Prometheus metrics

### Service probes and alerts

`monitoring.serviceProbes` contains HTTP checks that need stricter behavior than the basic webpage
HTML probes. The newsletter checks verify the public root page, CORS preflight, and a non-mutating
subscribe request. The subscribe probe posts a known-invalid list UUID to
`https://newsletter.bitsocial.net/api/bitsocial/subscribe` and expects the Bitsocial gateway to
return `403`. This does not create a subscriber, and it catches regressions where Caddy accidentally
routes the API path to raw listmonk.

Telegram alerts are disabled until these environment variables are set for the monitor container:

```bash
BITSOCIAL_STATS_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
BITSOCIAL_STATS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=
```

Alerts are sent only on state transitions: first failure, then recovery.
